# Rust-Based Graph Analysis + NLP Neural Network on Wikipedia Dataset
● Developed a neural network in Rust to predict link relationships between Wikipedia articles using Word2Vec
embeddings.
● Built a custom Rust module for graph traversal and analysis (e.g., finding most connected nodes, average path
lengths).
● Preprocessed data in Python (Gensim) and engineered synthetic “false” edges for supervised learning.
● Implemented ReLU-activated hidden layers (Kaiming Init) and sigmoid output (Xavier Init) with full
forward/backward pass. Explored effectiveness of embedding difference vectors as semantic similarity predictors
— concluded this method was ineffective for the task, reinforcing model evaluation skills.
